	 <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It is crucial for determining the efficiency of an algorithm.</p>
    <p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm refers to the amount of memory space required by the algorithm as a function of the input size. For example, an algorithm with a Space Complexity of O(n) means that the space required grows linearly with the input size.</p>
